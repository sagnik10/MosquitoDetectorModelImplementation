# Mosquito Detection Using TensorFlow and Keras

## Introduction
Mosquito-borne diseases pose serious public health threats. This project aims to develop a deep learning model for mosquito detection to aid disease control efforts. The model utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, and the MobileNetV2 architecture for accurate mosquito species classification.

## Literature Review
Mosquito detection plays a crucial role in disease prevention. Previous approaches have ranged from traditional methods to advanced deep learning techniques. Advances in object detection algorithms, such as MobileNetV2, have significantly improved accuracy and efficiency in detecting objects within images.

## Methodology
### Dataset Description
The dataset comprises labeled images of various mosquito species. Each image is associated with mosquito type, dimensions, and bounding box coordinates.

### Data Preprocessing
Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and augmented to ensure model generalization. Data preprocessing enhances the model's ability to learn important features.

### Model Architecture
MobileNetV2 is chosen for its lightweight architecture and proven effectiveness in object detection tasks. The final layers are adapted to output eight classes corresponding to different mosquito types.

### Model Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Training is conducted on a GPU, monitoring validation loss to prevent overfitting.

### Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation includes precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance for different mosquito species.

## Implementation
